# CANINE PROJECT
In this project, we demonstrate when it is worth using
CANINE by comparing it with BERT on text classification.
In addition, we verify to what extent character-level embed-
ding does not depend on the existence of clean and well-
spelled data as mentioned in the CANINE paper. Finally,
we evaluate whether CANINE exhibits more robustness than
the traditional BERT to verify the claims that the character-
level language model exhibits greater robustness to adver-
sarial manipulation
